# Portfolio Project
This project is my personal portfolio which help you get to know me better.

This is all of my collection of projects and experiences about coding.

Look at my portfolio website [Lottazdev](link when deploy).

## How I Build This Project?
I used all of my knowledge about wed development but just a basic. 

(**It could be better soon**)

I Use...
- HTML 5
- CSS 3 (no framework)
- Javascript (a little bit)

## How I Start?
- First, I researched a refference i suitable for me then designed the appearance of my portfolio website or UI by using figma.
- I built a structure of each page by using HTML no styling for this step (but, you can use border to separate each part).
- I prepared all information which I want to display on website (do not use the sensitive information).
- Ready to make it beatiful by CSS (I decided to use vanila CSS because it reminded me about the fundamental and good for study why should use libraries or framework).
- All UI is already done so time to use javascript .
- I use javascript to help about styling and directly sending an email for contacting to my email.
- I added some feature the toggle to switch a theme dark or light mode depens on user which one you prefer.
- Next, I added another feature download my CV when the button was clicked then CV file will appear on the browser tab and can download file on this tab.
- when things are ready I test it on my local computer if it's broken then fixed.
- After test and fix repeat it many time, It's time to deploy my website on internet.
